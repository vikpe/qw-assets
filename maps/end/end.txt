This is Quake's end map compiled from GPL'd .map sources.

SputnikUtah edited it to remove the redundant exit room and compiled the map with Baker5's simple.wad (flat textures).

Then I added colored lighting (BSPX extension) and changed the entity lump to be equivalent to the vanilla end.bsp.

The map's checksum is the same as the vanilla map's, so you can play it on any public QuakeWorld server with any QW client.
