This map is compiled from GPL sources with Baker5's simple.wad, with integrated colored lighting (BSPX extension)

The original dm1.map file released by John Romero wasn't compatible with the dm1.bsp from pak1.pak: builtin model numbers didn't match.  I fixed that by reordering the brushes in the .map file to match the 'vanilla' dm1.bsp.

The checksum is the same as in the vanilla map from pak1.pak, so it can be used for online play in any QW client.
